# RGBLS
The goal of this program is to use LEDscape on the BeagleBone Black to control individually-addressable RGB LED strips according to sampled music input.

This is a program designed specifically for Yona-Appletree's LEDscape fork. There are four 60-length NeoPixel strips in the first four LEDscape ports, respectively. There is a 8x32 matrix in the fifth port that displays the result of the FFT.
